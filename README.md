# CSCI-576Project
Hyperlinked Video Project for class

A sample program to display and manipulate images in left and right panels. This has been
given as java code to create and display a plain white rgb image of the specified format explained in the homework, draws a black line, and then displays it on screen.


Unzip the folder to where you want.
To run the code from command line, first compile with:

>> javac finalproject/*.java
and then, you can run it to take in a single parameter "n":

>> java finalproject.Editor
where the given parameter is a "dummy" parameter used to give an example of command line args in Java.
